# Work Product
Work product consists of both the end result (usually a code repository, for example) of your work _as well as_ the artifacts of a _productive_ process towards that goal.
Work product has several uses: project management, commit messages, presentation, goals, evaluation; 

# Evaluations and References
Some hiring platforms relay heavily on accurate references and more subjective evaluations.  It is ineffective to provide future employers with references and evaluations based solely on lines of code, which do not provide enough information about an employee's contribution to a project and team.  Instead, I rely substantially on these activities:

0. Learning Objectives
  * AI
  * Refactoring principles
  * HTTP

1. Meeting contributions - ask questions (there are no stupid question) and be thoughtful about your tasks and problem solving.

2. Git commit messages - Other than your code, your commit messages are the best record of your coding style and progress.  See more about how this is possible.

3. Project README - Your project README is the sole source of your ability to summarize the intention behind your project, the needs it seeks to satisfy and the examples of how to install, implement and use your project.

4. Documentation - Good documentation is evidence of a rational consistency to your code base.

5. Personal README - Your personal README file enhances your publicly visible GitHub or GitLab account and serves both as a profile that informs visitors about your coding competencies and as a guide for visitors to better understand the breadth and depth of proficiencies demonstrated in your repositories.
