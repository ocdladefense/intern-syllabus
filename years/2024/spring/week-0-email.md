# OCDLA Web Developer Internship, Spring '24 Kickoff Meeting
Tuesday, April 2, 2024 &mdash; 10:00 am - 2:00 pm<br />
Location: Virtual - [Zoom link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/88966004606)

## Meeting description
Welcome to the OCDLA Web Developer Internship.  I'm happy to have you assisting OCDLA with this term's web application projects.  We will use our first kickoff meeting to dive right into some coding best practices.  We'll want to see how these best practices influence the structure of some projects you've already completed; in turn, we want to demonstrate that our code is always a reflection of how we articulate the programming problem we are trying to solve. We'll also use meeting time to discuss additional programming principles, other philosophical approaches to development, internship requirements and then a crash course on Salesforce, Visualforce and Apex programming.  Some meeting prep tips and our (tentative) meeting agenda follow.


## Meeting preparation
* Register for a Salesforce Developer Org - you will use your developer org to engage in Salesforce-related CRM development and we will  migrate your applications from our first code review into a Salesforce instance.
* Install the Salesforce Extension Pack for VSCode
* Create a new Salesforce package/repository locally
* Connect to your Salesforce Developer Org from VSCode
* Be ready to discuss your week 0 coding projects (Course Info and Timer)
