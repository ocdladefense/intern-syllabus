Here's why the name fits:

Like other types of web workers, service workers run on a separate thread from the main JavaScript execution thread. This allows them to perform tasks in the background without blocking the user interface, making your app smoother and more responsive.

Caching: They can intercept network requests and cache assets, allowing your app to work offline or load faster.
>
Push notifications: They can receive push messages from a server and display notifications to the user, even when the app is not actively being used.
Background sync: They can sync data in the background, ensuring that data is updated even if the user loses connectivity.
In summary, the name "Service Worker" reflects their role as background processes that provide essential services to improve the functionality and performance of web applications.
