# Application caching

## Chrome dev tools
To view information about whether a file was loaded over the network or via a cache, use the dev tools Network tab and add the "Size" column.  This column will either indicate "memory cache", "file cache", "service worker" or list the size (in bytes, kB or mB) or the data transferred over the wire.
