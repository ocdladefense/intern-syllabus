# What is JSX?
JSX is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript without any defined semantics. It's NOT intended to be implemented by engines or browsers. It's NOT a proposal to incorporate JSX into the ECMAScript spec itself. It's intended to be used by various preprocessors (transpilers) to transform these tokens into standard ECMAScript.

### ... and how does it relate to JavaScript?
JSX is an extension to the ECMAScript language enabling the meaningful use of XML entities within JavaScript definition and execution contexts.
